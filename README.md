# 🛡️ Smart Practices for Strong & Secure Passwords
Go Long – Aim for 12–16 characters at minimum; more characters mean better security.

Diversify Characters – Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols for maximum strength.

Be Random – Steer clear of dictionary words, personal names, or predictable sequences.

Stay Unique – Use a different password for every site or service you access.

Use a Password Manager – Tools like Bitwarden or KeePass help you create and safely store strong, unique passwords.

Skip Browser Autofill – For high-security accounts, avoid saving passwords in your browser; rely on a dedicated manager instead.

Group by Importance –

Critical Accounts (Email, Banking) – Use the highest security passwords; refresh them at least every 4 months.

Low-Risk Accounts (Temporary Sign-ups) – Use separate passwords, never reuse ones from critical accounts.

Refresh Regularly – Update sensitive account passwords every few months to reduce breach risks.

# 🔑 Pro Tips for Stronger Password Security
Don’t Repeat Passwords – Every account should have its own unique login credentials.

Avoid Personal Details – Stay away from using names, birthdays, or other identifiable information.

Try Passphrases – Link together 4–7 unrelated words to form a long, memorable key (e.g., MoonRiverChairLaptopEagle).

Use a Password Manager – Securely store and encrypt your credentials while keeping them organized.

Enable MFA/2FA – Add an extra verification step to protect your most valuable accounts.

Adopt Future-Ready Login Methods – Where available, turn on passkeys or passwordless authentication for improved security.

# 🚨 Common Password Threats & How to Counter Them
1. Brute Force
Attackers systematically try every possible combination until they succeed.
Defense: Use lengthy passwords with mixed characters to make guessing impractical.

2. Dictionary Attack
Relies on precompiled lists of common words or phrases.
Defense: Avoid recognizable words and predictable substitutions like “P@ssw0rd.”

3. Credential Stuffing
Hackers use previously stolen usernames and passwords to access multiple accounts.
Defense: Always use different passwords for different sites.

4. Password Spraying
Instead of attacking one account repeatedly, attackers try a handful of common passwords across many accounts.
Defense: Avoid widely used passwords like “123456” or “admin.”

5. Keylogging
Malware records every keystroke you make, including passwords.
Defense: Keep your device clean with reputable security tools and avoid clicking suspicious links.

6. Rainbow Table Attacks
Uses large precomputed lists of hashed passwords to crack stored credentials.
Defense (for admins & developers): Store passwords using strong, salted hashing algorithms

# 📄 Task Summary
This task focused on understanding what makes a password secure, creating multiple password samples with varying complexity, and testing them using online strength evaluation tools. The exercise included researching modern authentication practices, exploring common password attack methods, and identifying strategies to defend against them.

By experimenting with passwords ranging from simple numeric sequences to complex, random strings and passphrases, the activity demonstrated how length, unpredictability, and diversity of characters significantly impact password resilience. Additional emphasis was placed on the use of password managers, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and emerging passwordless technologies to enhance overall account security.

# 🎯 Outcomes
Hands-on Testing – Evaluated multiple passwords using tools like NordPass Password Strength Checker, PasswordMeter.

Practical Insights – Learned how complexity, randomness, and length affect password strength and resistance to attacks.

Best Practices Identified – Developed a set of actionable guidelines for creating and managing secure credentials.

Attack Awareness – Gained knowledge about common password attacks (brute force, dictionary, credential stuffing, etc.) and how to mitigate them.

Advanced Security Understanding – Explored MFA, password managers, and passkey-based authentication as modern security enhancements.

Professional Documentation – Created a GitHub-ready report with tables, explanations, and recommendations for real-world application.
